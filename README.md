The code stored in this repository will be used to update Sfams protein families. The Sfams paper can be found here :
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/13/264/abstract

The main contributors to this repository are Guillaume Jospin, Stephen Nayfach and Thomas Sharpton.

The code is currently in progress and not suited for public use at this time.

We are making use of Thomas Sharpton's MRC libraries https://github.com/sharpton/MRC
We are also using DBI, Bio::Seqio as perl modules.
Programs used at this time are (but not limited to) Last and the HMMER suite.

We are also assuming the use of a computing cluster, depending on the coniguration commands might need to be altered.  The MySQL database used is available on the Sfams website.
